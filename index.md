## What:

A regular meeting of researchers who are always learning new tips and tricks to
make their computational work flow more smoothly.  In these friendly sessions,
peers at all levels of experience share topics useful in our scientific
software development workflows.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off
useful features of a scientific library or programming language you're using,
or bringing up a computational problem you're having.

## Who:

Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to come to our meetings.


## When:

TBD

## How:

* [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ucla-hacker-within)

## Why:

The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility,
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail
to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version
control, automated documentation, and others.

To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for
computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The
Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of
the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their
education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in
using computing to accomplish their work.
